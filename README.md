# Data-Cleaning-in-SQL
"Housing Data Cleaning Project"
In the "Housing Data Cleaning" project, I demonstrated robust data cleaning skills, resulting in a streamlined and standardized dataset.
 Key actions included:
•	Standardizing Date Format: Ensuring uniformity and ease of analysis.
•	Breaking down Property Address: Transforming it into distinct columns (Address, City).
•	Refining Owner Address: Segmenting it into separate columns (Address, City, State).
•	Enhancing "Sold as Vacant" Field: Replacing 'Y' and 'N' with 'Yes' and 'No' for clarity.
•	Populating Property Address Data: Ensuring data completeness.
This meticulous data cleansing process eliminated inconsistencies, enhanced data quality, and paved the way for more accurate and insightful analysis, showcasing the tangible benefits of effective data cleansing techniques.
